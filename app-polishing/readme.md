# App Polishing

## Introduction

Thus far in this course, the priority has been building apps with functionality. However, as you get closer to the end of the course, you will be building applications that could be shown to a potential employer.

An app that is well-designed and has been polished will stand out much more than an app that only has the core functionality with little to no thought about how the user(s) experience the app.

Each app will have its own unique challenges and incorporating the tools and assets you need will require some research on your part. Being able to teach yourself new things is an integral skill as a developer.
